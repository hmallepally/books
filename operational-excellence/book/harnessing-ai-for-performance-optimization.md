    def inspect_product(self, image):
        # Preprocess image
        processed_image = self.preprocess_image(image)
        
        # Run AI prediction
        prediction = self.model.predict(processed_image)
        confidence = np.max(prediction)
        
        # Determine quality status
        if confidence > self.confidence_threshold:
            return "PASS", confidence
        else:
            return "FAIL", confidence
    
    def preprocess_image(self, image):
        # Resize, normalize, and format for model input
        resized = cv2.resize(image, (224, 224))
        normalized = resized / 255.0
        batched = np.expand_dims(normalized, axis=0)
        return batched
```

**2. Predictive Quality Analytics**

AI systems can predict quality issues before they occur:

```python

class PredictiveQualityMonitor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100)
        self.feature_columns = ['temperature', 'pressure', 'speed', 'humidity']
        
    def train_model(self, historical_data):
        X = historical_data[self.feature_columns]
        y = historical_data['quality_score']
        self.model.fit(X, y)
        
    def predict_quality_risk(self, current_conditions):
        prediction = self.model.predict([current_conditions])
        risk_level = self.calculate_risk_level(prediction[0])
        return risk_level, prediction[0]
    
    def calculate_risk_level(self, quality_score):
        if quality_score >= 0.9:
            return "LOW"
        elif quality_score >= 0.7:

        else:
            return "HIGH"
```

**3. Natural Language Processing for Quality Documentation**

from textblob import TextBlob

class QualityReportAnalyzer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
        
    def analyze_report(self, report_text):
        # Extract key entities
        doc = self.nlp(report_text)
        entities = [(ent.text, ent.label_) for ent in doc.ents]
        
        # Sentiment analysis
        sentiment = TextBlob(report_text).sentiment.polarity
        
        # Extract quality issues
        quality_issues = self.extract_quality_issues(report_text)
        
        return {
            'entities': entities,

            'quality_issues': quality_issues
        }
    
    def extract_quality_issues(self, text):
        # Identify quality-related keywords and phrases
        quality_keywords = ['defect', 'failure', 'reject', 'scrap', 'rework']
        issues = []
        
        for keyword in quality_keywords:
            if keyword.lower() in text.lower():
                # Extract context around keyword
                context = self.extract_context(text, keyword)
                issues.append(context)
